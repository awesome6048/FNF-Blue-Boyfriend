# FNF-Blue-Boyfriend
1. Download the file.
2. Go to assets/images in your Friday Night Funkin' game files.
3. Delete (or move somewhere safe if you don't want the skin forever) the "BOYFRIEND" sprite sheet.
4. Drag the downloaded image to the assets/images folder.
5. Open the game.

If you did everything right, then when you play a song, the boyfriend should be blue.

If you did not do anything right, then restart the process.
